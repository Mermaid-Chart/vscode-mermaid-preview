A diagram:

.. mermaid::
  sequenceDiagram
      participant Alice
      participant Bob
      Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
      loop Healthcheck
          John->John: Fight against hypochondria
      end
      Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
      John-->Alice: Great!
      John->Bob: How about you?


      Bob-->John: Jolly good!

A random paragraph.

A diagram with parameters (the parameters can't be considered as part of the mermaid markup):

.. mermaid::
    :alt: The image alternate text for HTML output
    :align: center
    :caption: Caption Text underneath the generated image

    sequenceDiagram
      participant Alice
      participant Bob
      Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
      loop Healthcheck
          John->John: Fight against hypochondria
      end
      Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
      John-->Alice: Great!
      John->Bob: How about you?



      Bob-->John: Jolly good!

A diagram on an external file. You might decide not to match it, as the file itself can be previewed easily:

.. mermaid:: graphs/mygraph.mmd

Another diagram on an external file. Now with parameters:

.. mermaid:: graphs/mygraph.mmd
    :alt: The image alternate text for HTML output
    :align: center
    :caption: Caption Text underneath the generated image

Two diagrams one after the other. Should be matched separately. The file ends with no paragraph after the last diagram:

.. mermaid::
  sequenceDiagram
      participant Alice
      participant Bob
      Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
      loop Healthcheck
          John->John: Fight against hypochondria
      end
      Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
      John-->Alice: Great!
      John->Bob: How about you?


      Bob-->John: Jolly good!

.. mermaid::
    :go home:
    :alt: The image alternate text for HTML output

      Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
      loop Healthcheck
          John->John: Fight against hypochondria
      end
      Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
      John-->Alice: Great!
      John->Bob: How about you?
