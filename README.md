### Generate AI-powered diagrams directly from your code!
Transform your ideas and source code into clear, insightful diagrams with our new AI integration in VS Code.<br>
Just mention **@mermaid-chart** in any GitHub Copilot Chat and describe the diagram you want to create â€” even link specific source code files!<br>
 Whether it's a class diagram, sequence diagram, entity relationship diagram, or more â€” the AI assistant will analyze the code, generate the appropriate Mermaid syntax, and instantly show a live preview.<br>
Let your code speak for itself â€” effortlessly.

With Smart Diagram Regeneration, when your source code or requirements change, the extension can detect these changes and offer to update related diagrams with a single click.

### Real-Time local Edit & Preview 
Now you get a side-by-side real time preview of the mermaid diagram while editing the diagram locally. This helps the user to see the true power of a mermaid's text-based diagram, where each change in text is reflected immediately on the diagram.

![Real-Time local Edit & Preview](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-full-view.png)

### Syntax Highlighting 
We now support syntax highlighting for all Mermaid diagrams when writing the Mermaid code. The syntax highlighting works well with the developer selected theme for VS Code. 

![Syntax Highlighting](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-highlighting-dark.png)

### Pan & Zoom 
We now support Pan and Zoom for the diagram preview, where the user pan to a specific part of a large diagram, and also set different levels of zoom based on his preference. We implemented the zoom with stickiness, so that zoom levels are not changed when you edit your diagram
Users can of course use the reset option to resize the preview diagram to fit the screen.
![Pan & Zoom](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-pan.png)


### Error Highlighting 
While writing the mermaid code, if you encounter syntax errors, the extension highlights the syntax error with an error message, and also indicates which line in the code might be causing the error. This helps the user to locate and fix the error. 
![Error Highlighting](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-error-indicator.png)

### Auto-Detect Mermaid diagrams in Markdown files
The extension automatically detects mermaid diagrams in the markdown files using the ```mermaid``` code block. 

This gives a unique opportunity for the users, they can now preview and edit the diagrams by clicking the edit diagram link directly from within the markdown file.
![Auto-Detect Mermaid diagrams in Markdown files](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-markdown-view.png)

### Mermaid Diagram Preview in Markdown File
This extension enables **live preview of Mermaid diagrams** directly within the **Markdown preview** in VS Code. No need to leave your editor!
![Markdown Preview](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-markdown-mermaid-preview.png)

### Support .mmd file extension as Mermaid Markdown file
Now we provide native support for the .mmd  extension. All the local mermaid diagrams will be loaded as a .mmd file. You can notice that the .mmd also has the Mermaid logo in the file explorer view.
![Support .mmd file extension as Mermaid Markdown file](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-file-icons.png)

### Smart Auto-Suggest with code snippets
Now based on the diagram type auto suggestions for code snippets will be triggered on type of "m", and it will start showing relevant code snippets shorthand, that once selected, will expand to the proper code snippet.
![Smart Auto-Suggest with code snippets](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-code-suggestions.png)

### Diagram Help
If you get stuck with a diagram's syntax or want to learn about other features for a given diagram, now you can directly access the respective diagram's detailed documentation on the official mermaid.js docs.

#### Smart Sync to promote collaboration
